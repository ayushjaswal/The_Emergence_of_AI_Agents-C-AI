# ReAct Engine - AI Agent Loop

ReAct (Reason + Act) loop implementation for Mission 11 Conversational AI - The Emergence of AI Agents.

## Overview

This project implements the ReAct agent architecture that enables AI systems to think step-by-step, use tools, and self-correct. By combining reasoning ("Thought") with actions (tool execution), the agent can solve complex problems through iterative observation and decision-making.
